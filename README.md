# Poké Ball

A simple 3D model of a Poké Ball from Pokémon. 

## Creation

Made through scultping a cube into a spherical shape, inseting a ring in the middle, extruding a cylinder to act as the "button", and isolating the model into two distinct faces - one that's metallic red and the other a shiny white.
